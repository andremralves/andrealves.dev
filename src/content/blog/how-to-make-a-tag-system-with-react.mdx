## Motivation

The objective of this article is to help you to create a nice looking tag system with different colors and functions for each tag name in your react blog or site.

Here is how it looks like:

To accomplish this goal I will be using tailwindcss for my styles, typescript and, of course, react.

The idea here is to create a component called "Tag.tsx", or whatever you want, that will have one property, the name of the tag. With this property the component will know what are the attributes of this tag, e.g., the background color of the tag. Now, just follow these steps:

## 1. Create a react component

Note that we have a react component with one props object that will have one property called name (the name of the tag).

```tsx
import React from 'react'

type TagProps = {
  name: string
}

const Tag = (props: TagProps) => {
  return (
    <span className={`px-2 mr-2 bg-blue-300 rounded text-black`}>
      {props.name}
    </span>
  )
}

export default Tag
```

As you can see, we are using an default color for all the different tag names, but what we want is to have a
different color for each tag on our component. Let's change this.

## 2. Create an object to map tag names to their respective background colors

```tsx
import React from 'react'

type MapType = {
  [id: string]: string
}

const tagColor: MapType = {
  NextJs: 'bg-blue-300',
  Typescript: 'bg-blue-500',
  Python: 'bg-orange-500',
  Django: 'bg-green-600',
  React: 'bg-sky-400',
  Html: 'bg-yellow-200',
  Css: 'bg-purple-200',
  Bootstrap: 'bg-red-300',
  Tailwindcss: 'bg-green-300',
  SFML: 'bg-amber-500',
  'C++': 'bg-red-500',
  'Data Structures': 'bg-orange-300',
}

const Tag = (props: TagProps) => {
  return (
    <span className={`px-2 mr-2 bg-blue-300 rounded text-black`}>
      {props.name}
    </span>
  )
}

export default Tag
```

## 3. Use the tagColor object inside your component

Now, let's change the default "bg-blue-300" color, and use our map. Below you can
check the full code.

```tsx
import React from 'react'

type MapType = {
  [id: string]: string
}

const tagColor: MapType = {
  NextJs: 'bg-blue-300',
  Typescript: 'bg-blue-500',
  Python: 'bg-orange-500',
  Django: 'bg-green-600',
  React: 'bg-sky-400',
  Html: 'bg-yellow-200',
  Css: 'bg-purple-200',
  Bootstrap: 'bg-red-300',
  Tailwindcss: 'bg-green-300',
  SFML: 'bg-amber-500',
  'C++': 'bg-red-500',
  'Data Structures': 'bg-orange-300',
}

const Tag = (props: TagProps) => {
  return (
    <span className={`px-2 mr-2 ${tagColor[props.name]} rounded text-black`}>
      {props.name}
    </span>
  )
}

export default Tag
```

That is all, in this article you learned how to create different colors for each tag name using a map, but you can
apply this concept for whatever functionality you want, e.g., relate a different link for each tag, so the user can click and
be led to a page that shows just articles with this tag.
